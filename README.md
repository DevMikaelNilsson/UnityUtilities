This is a collection of usable scripts for the Unity engine.
The goal for this repository is to make game development within the Unity Editor a little faster and efficient,
by avoiding writing the same scripts over and over again.

All scripts are divided into different subfolders. Each subfolder contains a README.md file with a short information text
about each available component.
