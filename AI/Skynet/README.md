#SkyNet
This is a AI central component which can record data for all connected AI objects.
The SkyNet component records data and processes it and the result is send back to the AI to make it easier
for the AI object to make a decision from the data.

##Grid
Creates a custom sized Grid. The grid is tiled up in zones, and each zone can register/unregister a Transform object of any choice.
With the registration of the zones, the grid can make a sort of heat sensor, detecting where a object have been most active, helping the AI to find possible spots where the object might appear at any time.
